                        My name is Geordin Soucie and these are my GitHub Pages.<br>
                        <br>
                        Having recently enrolled at the University of Richmond's Web Development Bootcamp,
                        I am currently leaning towards back end development.
                        However, my passion lies with narrative. As an aspiring digital creator I spend much of my free
                        time
                        studying game design, narrative structure, and historical societies.
                        <br> <br>
                        As you can probably tell, I am a medieval enthusiast who likes to participate in various
                        medieval activities such as the events run by the Society of Creative Anachronism.
                        Unsurprisingly, I am also a huge fan of medieval fantasy.

                <p>
                    These three particular pages were an early homework assignment for the University of Richmond
                    Web Development Bootcamp.
                    If you are reading this, then I am still in the bootcmap program and have not yet created all of the
                    products in the portfolio.
                    But fear not, I will get to them soon.
                    In the meantime, here is some information about myself. </p>

                    <p>Geordin Soucie Was born in New England, on the eastern coast of the United States of America.
                        He graduated 10th in his high school class, just missing the top 10% by a single classmate.
                    </p>

                    <p>In 2014 Geordin Graduated from Clarkson University with a Bachelor's degree in Environmental
                        Science.
                        He spent the next four years traveling, working in different locations across the United States.
                        He has worked for the National Park Service, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and
                        Recreation, and Medieval Times LLC.
                    </p>
                    <p>He can often be found attending medieval or Sctottish festivals or attending similarly themed
                        filk, bardic or folk concerts.
                        He is an active member of the <a href="https://www.sca.org/" target="_blank">Society for
                            Creative Anachronism</a>,
